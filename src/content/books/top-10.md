It was published on 8 June 1949 by Secker & Warburg as Orwell's ninth and final book completed in his lifetime. Thematically, Nineteen Eighty-Four centres on the consequences of totalitarianism, mass surveillance, and repressive regimentation of persons and behaviours within society. Orwell, himself a democratic socialist, modelled the authoritarian government in the novel after Stalinist Russia. More broadly, the novel examines the role of truth and facts within politics and the ways in which they are manipulated."

It explains that money is the most pluralistic system of mutual trust ever devised; that capitalism is the most successful religion ever invented; that the treatment of animals in modern agriculture is probably the worst crime in history; and that even though we are far more powerful than our ancient ancestors, we aren’t much happier. By combining profound insights with a remarkably vivid language, Sapiens acquired cult status among diverse audiences, captivating teenagers as well as university professors, animal rights activists alongside government ministers."

But mostly it is the story of Ayla, the girl they found and raised, who was not like them. To the Clan, her fair looks make her different—ugly. And she has odd ways: she laughs, she cries, she has the abil- ity to speak. But even more, she struggles to be true to herself and, with her advanced intelligence, is curious about the world around her. Although Ayla is clearly a mem- ber of the Others, she is nurtured by her adoptive parents, befriended by members of the Clan, and gradually accepted into the family circle. But there are those who would cast her out for her strange, threatening ways."

    author: "Robert Sheckley"
    cover: "https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/33854/pg33854.cover.medium.jpg"
    summary: "Ask a Foolish Question by Robert Sheckley is a science fiction story written during the early 1950s. The narrative explores the philosophical implications of knowledge and inquiry through a central entity known as the Answerer, designed to provide answers to any question posed by the beings of the universe. The story raises intriguing questions about the nature of knowledge itself, highlighting how the formulation of a question can heavily influence the response received. In the tale, two central characters, Morran and Lingman, embark on a quest to find the Answerer, desperately seeking the ultimate truths about life and death. Meanwhile, a variety of other beings also seek answers to their own existential questions. However, when they finally confront the Answerer, they discover that their inquiries often lack the depth necessary to receive meaningful responses. The Answerer, while possessing vast knowledge, can only respond to questions that are framed correctly, exposing the limitations of the questioners' understanding. The story concludes with a poignant realization that without a foundational understanding, the questions posed will inevitably fail to reveal the profound truths they seek, emphasizing the complex relationship between knowledge, inquiry, and comprehension"

    cover: "https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/14586885-L.jpg"
    summary: "And Then There Were None is a mystery novel by the English writer Agatha Christie, described by her as the most difficult of her books to write. It was first published in the United Kingdom by the Collins Crime Club on 6 November 1939, as Ten Little Niggers, after the children's counting rhyme and minstrel song, which serves as a major element of the plot. A US edition was released in January 1940 with the title And Then There Were None, which is taken from the last five words of the song. All successive American reprints and adaptations use that title, except for the Pocket Books paperbacks published between 1964 and 1986, which appeared under the title Ten Little Indians. UK editions continued to use the original title until the current definitive title appeared with a reprint of the 1963 Fontana Paperback in 1985."
