I’m a Venezuelan physicist, with passion for problem solving and software development. 
I’m currently pursuing a PhD at [ICTQT](https://ictqt.ug.edu.pl/), in the [University of Gdansk](https://en.ug.edu.pl/). 
My work focuses on the description of Open Quantum Systems, particularly in 
Non-Markovian equations focusing on the [Refined Weak coupling/ExpZ map/ cumulant equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05776) and 
other techniques for the description of open systems such as [HEOM](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jcp/article/153/2/020901/76291/Numerically-exact-approach-to-open-quantum), [The Reaction Coordinate mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08307), 
[The time convolutionless equation (TCL)](https://indico.ictp.it/event/a10127/session/15/contribution/10/material/0/0.pdf), [TEDOPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03100) … etc

I started off my career as an Electronics Engineer, 
I later did a masters in experimental quantum optics at [CINVESTAV](https://www.cinvestav.mx/zacatenco/fisica), 
and now I’m pursuing a PhD in open quantum systems at [ICTQT](https://ictqt.ug.edu.pl/) under the 
supervision of [Michał Horodecki](https://ictqt.ug.edu.pl/pages/new-quantum-resources-and-thermodynamics/). I was previously an Intern at [Franco Nori's group in RIKEN](https://dml.riken.jp/) where I worked on enhancements [the QuTiP environment class](https://qutip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/guide-environments.html), that started me off contributing to open source which I still actively try to do.

I have some experience as a Python developer/data analyst on upwork, which was my focus prior to starting my PhD. In my free time I enjoy anime, cooking, video games, and trading, while I mainly avoid actively trading, I do have some fun selling some weekly covered calls once in a while.
