	abstract = {Quantum control allows us to address the problem of engineering quantum dynamics for special purposes. While recently the field of quantum batteries has attracted much attention, optimization of their charging has not benefited from the quantum control methods. Here we fill this gap by using an optimization method. We apply for the first time the convergent iterative method for the control of the population of a bipartite quantum system in two cases, starting with a qubit-qubit case. The quantum charger-battery system is considered here, where the energy is pumped into the charger by an external classical electromagnetic field. Secondly, we systematically extend our investigation to a second case involving two harmonic oscillators in the Gaussian regime, presenting an original formulation of the method. In both cases, the charger is considered to be an open dissipative system, as its interaction with the drive may require a more pronounced exposure to general interaction with environment. A key consideration in our optimization strategy is the practical concern of turning the charging external field on and off. We find that optimizing the pulse shape yields a substantial enhancement in both the power and efficiency of the charging process compared to a sinusoidal drive. The harmonic oscillator configuration of quantum batteries is particularly intriguing, as the optimal driving pulse remains effective regardless of the environmental temperature. This study introduces a novel approach to quantum battery charging optimization, opening avenues for enhanced performance in real-world applications.},

	abstract = {We treat the Cooper pairs in the superconducting electrodes of a Josephson junction (JJ) as an open system, coupled via Andreev scattering to external baths of electrons. The disequilibrium between the baths generates the direct-current bias applied to the JJ. In the weak-coupling limit we obtain a Markovian master equation that provides a simple dynamical description consistent with the main features of the JJ, including the form of the current–voltage characteristic, its hysteresis, and the appearance under periodic voltage driving of discrete Shapiro steps. For small dissipation, our model also exhibits a self-oscillation of the JJ’s electrical dipole with frequency around mean voltage V. This self-oscillation, associated with ‘hidden attractors’ of the nonlinear equations of motion, explains the observed production of monochromatic radiation with frequency Ω and its harmonics. We argue that this picture of the JJ as a quantum engine resolves open questions about the Josephson effect as an irreversible process and could open new perspectives in quantum thermodynamics and in the theory of dynamical systems.},
